# ðŸ§¹ GitHub Actions Cleanup Complete

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### Problem: Multiple Conflicting Workflows
- **Issue:** Two workflow files (`deploy.yml` and `deploy-fixed.yml`) were running simultaneously
- **Symptoms:** Multiple workflow runs, some failing, causing confusion in GitHub Actions
- **Solution:** Removed duplicate `deploy-fixed.yml`, kept only the working `deploy.yml`

### Current Status: Clean & Working

#### âœ… **Single Workflow Configuration**
- **File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Name:** "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
- **Triggers:** Push to main/master branch + manual dispatch
- **Actions Used:**
  - `actions/checkout@v4`
  - `actions/setup-node@v4`
  - `pnpm/action-setup@v3`
  - `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.6.1`

#### âœ… **Build Test Results**
- **Local Build:** âœ… Successful (45 pages built)
- **Medium RSS:** âœ… Working with fallback handling
- **No Errors:** All build warnings are minor (line ending formats)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin master
# â†’ Triggers single, clean workflow
# â†’ Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically
```

### What Happens Now
1. Single workflow runs (no duplicates)
2. Uses pnpm for faster, more reliable builds
3. Handles Medium RSS gracefully (with fallback)
4. Deploys 45 pages successfully
5. Updates site at: https://anykolaiszyn.github.io/trailblazer-analytics-devkit/

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

### GitHub Actions Tab Should Show
- âœ… Single workflow run per push
- âœ… "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- âœ… Green checkmarks for successful deployments
- âœ… No more conflicting or duplicate runs

### Site Status
- **URL:** https://anykolaiszyn.github.io/trailblazer-analytics-devkit/
- **Pages:** 45 total pages building successfully
- **Content:** All blog posts, case studies, downloads, etc.
- **Navigation:** Clean, professional structure

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Check GitHub Actions tab for green builds
- Site should update within 2-3 minutes of push
- All 45 pages should remain accessible

### Troubleshooting
If any issues occur:
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for error details
2. Verify only one workflow file exists
3. Use manual deployment as backup: `pnpm run deploy:clean`
