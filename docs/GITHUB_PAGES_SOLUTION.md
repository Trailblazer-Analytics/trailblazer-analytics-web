# GitHub Pages Deployment Solution

A summary of the changes made to fix the GitHub Pages deployment issues.

## ✅ Problem Solved
- Fixed 404 errors for CSS and JS files on GitHub Pages
- Ensured proper rendering of the site with all styles intact
- Improved deployment workflow with automated scripts
- Added debugging tools for easier troubleshooting

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was related to GitHub Pages' handling of directories that start with underscores (`_`). By default, Astro places assets in an `_astro` directory, which GitHub Pages doesn't handle correctly due to Jekyll's default processing.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Changes
- Changed asset directory from `_astro/` to `assets/` in `astro.config.mjs`:
  ```javascript
  build: {
    assets: "assets",
  }
  ```
- Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent GitHub Pages from processing the site with Jekyll

### 2. Debugging Enhancements
- Added debugging script to `Base.astro` that can be enabled with `?debug=true` query parameter
- Created a custom 404.html page with debugging information
- Added a build verification script (`verify-build.js`) to check asset paths

### 3. Deployment Improvements
- Added npm scripts for easier deployment:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy        # Standard deployment
  npm run deploy:clean  # Clean deployment (removes history)
  ```
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments
- Created comprehensive documentation in `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## 📚 Documentation
For detailed information about the deployment process, troubleshooting, and best practices, see the [GitHub Pages Deployment Guide](./GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Implement caching strategy for better performance
- Add preloading for critical assets
- Consider service worker for offline support

## 📈 Results
The site now deploys correctly to GitHub Pages with all CSS and JavaScript files loading properly. The improved workflow makes future deployments simpler and more reliable.
