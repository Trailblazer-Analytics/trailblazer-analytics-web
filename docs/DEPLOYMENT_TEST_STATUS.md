# 🧪 Deployment Test Status

## ✅ GitHub Actions CI Fix Applied

### Issue Resolved: `ERR_PNPM_NO_LOCKFILE`

**Problem:** 
- GitHub Actions failed with: "Cannot install with 'frozen-lockfile' because pnpm-lock.yaml is absent"
- The lockfile existed locally but wasn't committed to the repository

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Added `pnpm-lock.yaml` to Git repository
2. ✅ Updated lockfile to match current `package.json` dependencies  
3. ✅ Verified frozen lockfile installation works locally
4. ✅ Confirmed full build works (45 pages built successfully)
5. ✅ Pushed changes to trigger deployment test

## 🚀 Expected Results

### GitHub Actions Should Now:
- ✅ Find `pnpm-lock.yaml` in repository
- ✅ Install dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- ✅ Run Medium RSS fetch (with graceful fallback)
- ✅ Build all 45 pages successfully
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Build Process Verified:
```bash
# Local test results:
✅ pnpm install --frozen-lockfile  # Works
✅ pnpm run build                  # 45 pages built
✅ Medium RSS fetch                # Working with fallback
✅ All content types               # Blog, case studies, etc.
```

## 📊 Current Status

- **Site:** https://anykolaiszyn.github.io/trailblazer-analytics-devkit/
- **Local Build:** ✅ 45 pages built successfully
- **Dependencies:** ✅ All installed and working
- **Medium RSS:** ✅ Working with error handling
- **Deployment:** 🔄 GitHub Actions test in progress

## 🔍 What to Monitor

### GitHub Actions Tab Should Show:
1. ✅ Successful checkout
2. ✅ Node.js and pnpm setup
3. ✅ Dependencies installed with frozen lockfile
4. ✅ Build completed (45 pages)
5. ✅ Deployment to GitHub Pages

### If Successful:
- Site updates within 2-3 minutes
- All 45 pages remain accessible
- No build or deployment errors

### If Issues Persist:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Use manual deployment backup: `pnpm run deploy:clean`
- Review lockfile or dependency conflicts
