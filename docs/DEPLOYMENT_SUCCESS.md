# ðŸŽ‰ DEPLOYMENT ISSUES RESOLVED - June 11, 2025

## âœ… Status: FIXED AND DEPLOYED

### Issues That Were Resolved

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Failure
**Problem:** "Deploy to GitHub Pages workflow run failed" with exit code 1
- YAML formatting errors and duplicate properties
- Malformed indentation causing workflow parsing failures

**Solution:** âœ… FIXED
- Recreated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with proper YAML syntax
- Fixed pnpm configuration and dependencies
- Removed duplicate `clean: true` property

#### 2. Medium RSS Rate Limiting (429 Error)
**Problem:** Build failing due to Medium RSS feed rate limiting
```
Error fetching Medium RSS feed: Error: Status code 429
Process completed with exit code 1
```

**Solution:** âœ… FIXED  
- Enhanced `scripts/fetch-medium.js` with graceful error handling
- Falls back to cached data when API is unavailable
- Creates empty data file if no cache exists
- **Build no longer fails** when Medium API is rate limited

#### 3. Documentation Organization
**Problem:** Documentation scattered between root and docs folder

**Solution:** âœ… COMPLETED
- All documentation consolidated in `/docs` folder
- Updated README.md with correct paths
- Created comprehensive documentation hub

## ðŸš€ Current Site Status

- **Live Site:** https://anykolaiszyn.github.io/trailblazer-analytics-devkit/
- **Build Status:** âœ… Successful deployment
- **GitHub Actions:** âœ… Working correctly
- **Medium Integration:** âœ… Resilient to API failures
- **Documentation:** âœ… Fully consolidated and organized

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements Made

### Build Resilience
