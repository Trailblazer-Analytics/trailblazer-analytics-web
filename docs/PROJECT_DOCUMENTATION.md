});
```

#### Important Files

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- `scripts/verify-build.js`: Tool to verify asset paths in build output

For detailed GitHub Pages deployment information, see [GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md](./GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Content Management

### Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored as MDX files in `src/content/blog/`. Each post should include the following frontmatter:

```yaml

## Known Issues

1. **Shiki Language Warning**: "The language 'tableau' doesn't exist, falling back to 'plaintext'" - This is a warning during build but doesn't affect functionality
2. **API Routes Warning**: Warnings about API routes during build - These are expected as we only have POST handlers
