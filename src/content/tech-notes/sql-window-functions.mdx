# SQL Window Functions Explained

Window functions are powerful SQL features that perform calculations across rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they don't group rows into a single output row.

## Basic Syntax

```sql
function_name() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ROWS/RANGE window_frame]
)
```

## Common Window Functions

### 1. ROW_NUMBER()
Assigns unique sequential integers to rows:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 2. RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
Assign ranks with different tie handling:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_with_gaps,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 3. LAG() and LEAD()
Access previous or next row values:

```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as previous_revenue,
    LEAD(revenue, 1) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) as next_revenue
FROM daily_sales;
```

## Practical Examples

### Running Totals
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    daily_revenue,
    SUM(daily_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) as running_total
FROM daily_sales;
```

### Moving Averages
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    daily_revenue,
    AVG(daily_revenue) OVER (
        ORDER BY order_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as seven_day_avg
FROM daily_sales;
```

### Percentiles
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    salary,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) as percentile_rank,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as quartile
FROM employees;
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Index ORDER BY columns** for better performance
2. **Use PARTITION BY** to limit window scope
3. **Consider materializing** complex window calculations
4. **Avoid unnecessary sorting** in the window frame

Window functions are essential for advanced analytics and can replace complex self-joins in many scenarios.
