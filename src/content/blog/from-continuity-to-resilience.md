A traditional Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is designed to keep operations afloat during disruptions. But when combined with Disaster Intelligence, it becomes a proactive engine for building long-term resilience.

Rather than waiting for disaster to strike, organizations can use the insights from their BCPs and key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify opportunities for adaptive change.

## Disaster Intelligence as a Complement to BCP

Disaster Intelligence doesn't replace your continuity plan—it **enhances** it. Think of it as a continuous improvement loop powered by analytics and scenario planning.

**Getting Started:** Even if your organization doesn't have a formal BCP, you can start today using what you already measure. Begin by identifying your core business functions and the resources that support them—people, processes, systems, and data. Then ask: **how resilient is each to disruption?**

## Step-by-Step Scenario: Order Processing Function

Let's walk through a practical application of Disaster Intelligence on a critical business function.

**Business Function:** 📦 Order Processing

### 📊 Current State Analysis

**👥 Human Resources:**

- Centralized team located in a single corporate office

**💻 IT Resources:**

- On-premise software within the office network

**🖥️ Physical Assets:**

- Company desktops/laptops

**📋 Documents:**

- Paper-based documents moved between departments

### 🛡️ Continuity Mitigation Summary

In the event of a localized outage, the team can use VPN and laptops to work remotely. In a major disruption, key personnel relocate to a disaster recovery site to resume operations.

## 🧠 Applying Disaster Intelligence: Key Questions to Ask

### 👥 Human Resources

- ❓ Does this team need to be physically in-office?
- 💰 Are there cost or productivity benefits to remote work?
- 🌐 Could a distributed or outsourced model improve agility?

### 💻 IT Resources

- ☁️ Can we transition operations to cloud-based systems?
- 🔒 Is our VPN infrastructure scalable and secure for full remote access?

### 🖥️ Physical Assets

- 📱 Would a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model work with proper security controls?
- 💻 Can we reduce costs and risk by adopting virtual desktops?

### 📋 Documents

- 💰 What is the cost of managing physical documentation?
- ✍️ Can we digitize records and implement secure e-signature workflows?

## 🚀 Future State: A Resilient Order Processing Function

### 👥 Human Resources

The team now operates remotely with expanded geographic distribution, increasing resilience and talent access. Cross-regional support ensures business continuity during localized disruptions.

### 💻 IT Resources

Key systems are virtualized and VPN-enabled. While full cloud migration isn't feasible, a failover cloud infrastructure supports critical processes in emergencies.

### 🖥️ Physical Assets

Employees use company-issued laptops with access to virtual desktops, reducing data loss risks and hardware costs.

### 📋 Documents

Legacy documents are managed offsite for compliance. All new documentation is digital, enabling remote access and streamlined workflows.

## 📋 Action Plan for Analysts & Leaders

1. **🎯 Identify Core Functions**: Select 2–3 core functions to analyze using this model
2. **🗺️ Map Current State**: Document the current state of each function  
3. **⚠️ Explore Disruptions**: Consider potential disruptions and their impacts
4. **💡 Propose Changes**: Suggest technology, policy, or process changes to build resilience
5. **📝 Update BCP**: Reflect new operational realities in your Business Continuity Plan

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

When organizations evolve their continuity strategies with data-driven insights, **resilience becomes a cultural norm**—not just a crisis response.

Disaster Intelligence invites us to continually ask: **How can we future-proof our operations today?**
