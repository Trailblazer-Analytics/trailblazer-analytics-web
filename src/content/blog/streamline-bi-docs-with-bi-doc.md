In today‚Äôs fast-paced analytics world, keeping your BI assets well-documented and up-to-date is critical‚Äîbut often tedious. That‚Äôs where **bi‚Äëdoc** from Trailblazer Analytics comes in.

- **Power BI** `.pbix` files
- **Tableau** `.twb` and `.twbx` workbooks

‚Ä¶and outputs polished, human-friendly documentation in **Markdown** and **JSON** formats.
