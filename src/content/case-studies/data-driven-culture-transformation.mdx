            'user_representatives': 'Frontline Supervisors'
        }
    
    def develop_cultural_policies(self):
        """Policies that reinforce data-driven culture"""
        return {
            'decision_documentation': 'All decisions > $10K must include data rationale',
            'best_practice_sharing': 'Monthly sharing of data-driven improvements',
            'training_requirements': 'Annual analytics skills assessment for all supervisors',
