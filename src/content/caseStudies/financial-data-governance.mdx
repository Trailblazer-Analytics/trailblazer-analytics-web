   - Azure Data Factory for ETL standardization

### Phase 3: Implementation and Controls (Months 4-7)

**Data Quality Implementation:**
```sql
-- Example: Client data quality rule
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_client_data()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Email format validation
    IF NEW.email !~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid email format: %', NEW.email;
    END IF;
    
    -- SSN format validation (US clients)
    IF NEW.country = 'US' AND NEW.ssn !~ '^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$' THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid SSN format: %', NEW.ssn;
    END IF;
    
    -- Investment profile completeness
    IF NEW.risk_tolerance IS NULL OR NEW.investment_objective IS NULL THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Incomplete investment profile for client: %', NEW.client_id;
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

        self.reporting_period = reporting_period
        self.data_quality_threshold = 0.95
    
    def generate_report(self):
        # Data quality validation
        quality_score = self.validate_data_quality()
        if quality_score < self.data_quality_threshold:
            raise DataQualityException(f"Data quality below threshold: {quality_score}")
        
        # Generate report based on type
        if self.report_type == "FORM_PF":
            return self.generate_form_pf()
        elif self.report_type == "FORM_ADV":
            return self.generate_form_adv()
        
    def validate_data_quality(self):
        # Comprehensive data quality checks
        completeness_score = self.check_completeness()
        accuracy_score = self.check_accuracy()
        consistency_score = self.check_consistency()
        
        return (completeness_score + accuracy_score + consistency_score) / 3
```
