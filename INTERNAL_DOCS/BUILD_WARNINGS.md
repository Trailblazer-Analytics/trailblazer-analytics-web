# Build Warnings and Fixes

During the build process of the Trailblazer Analytics site, several warnings were identified. This document outlines these issues and provides recommendations for addressing them.

## 1. Unsupported File Type

```bash
[WARN] Unsupported file type G:\SecretProjects\trailblazer-analytics-devkit\src\pages\insights.astro.fixed found.
```

**Recommendation**:

- Either rename the file to `insights.astro` if it's meant to be a page
- Or prefix the filename with an underscore (`_insights.astro.fixed`) to have Astro ignore it
- Or remove the file if it's no longer needed

## 2. Route Collisions

```bash
[WARN] [router] The route "/blog" is defined in both "src/pages/blog/index.astro" and "src/pages/blog.astro".
[WARN] [router] The route "/case-studies" is defined in both "src/pages/case-studies/index.astro" and "src/pages/case-studies.astro".
```

**Issue**: Multiple files are defining the same route, which will cause errors in future Astro versions.

**Recommendation**:

- Keep only one of each pair:
  - Either `src/pages/blog/index.astro` OR `src/pages/blog.astro`
  - Either `src/pages/case-studies/index.astro` OR `src/pages/case-studies.astro`

## 3. Auto-generated Collections

```bash
Auto-generating collections for folders in "src/content/" that are not defined as collections.
This is deprecated, so you should define these collections yourself in "src/content.config.ts".
The following collections have been auto-generated: caseStudies, techNotes
```

**Issue**: Collections are being auto-generated, which is a deprecated feature in Astro.

**Recommendation**:

- Ensure all collections are properly defined in `src/content.config.ts`
- The file already has definitions for these collections, but they need to be properly exported

## 4. Missing Content Directories

```bash
[WARN] [glob-loader] The base directory "G:\SecretProjects\trailblazer-analytics-devkit\src\content\case-studies\" does not exist.
[WARN] [glob-loader] The base directory "G:\SecretProjects\trailblazer-analytics-devkit\src\content\tech-notes\" does not exist.
```

**Issue**: The content directories referenced in the configuration don't exist.

**Recommendation**:

- Create the missing directories:
  - `src/content/case-studies/`
  - `src/content/tech-notes/`
- Ensure the directory names match the collection names (dash vs. camel case)

## 5. Missing Collection References

```bash
The collection "case-studies" does not exist or is empty. Please check your content config file for errors.
```

**Issue**: Several pages are trying to access a collection named "case-studies" that doesn't exist or is empty.

**Recommendation**:

- Ensure collection names in the content config match the ones referenced in the pages
- The collection is defined as `caseStudies` (camelCase) but referenced as `case-studies` (kebab-case)
- Add proper error handling for missing collections in pages that use them

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix file naming issues**:
   - Rename or remove the `.fixed` file

2. **Resolve route collisions**:
   - Determine which files to keep and which to remove

3. **Fix collection configuration**:
   - Ensure proper export of collections in `content.config.ts`

4. **Create content directories**:
   - Create the missing directories with the correct naming convention

5. **Add error handling**:
   - Update pages to handle missing collections gracefully

These fixes will help ensure the build process runs smoothly and will prevent harder errors in future Astro versions.
