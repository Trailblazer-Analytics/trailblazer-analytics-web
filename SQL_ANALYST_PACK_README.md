## 💡 **From My Experience**

> **Pro Tip:** Start with the templates folder if you're new to analytics. These provide solid foundations that you can customize for your specific business needs.

> **Performance Note:** All scripts in the /performance folder have been tested on datasets with 10M+ rows. Your mileage may vary based on your database setup.

> **Real Talk:** Not every script here will fit your exact use case. That's intentional. Think of these as starting points that you can adapt and improve.
